Real time chat app created by Tousif Ahmed. Here I am using html, css, js, php, mysql
In this chat app, first we have to signup if we're new on the chat application then after successfully signed up, 
we'll be redirected to the users area page where users like me who have signed to this chat app will appear there with my full name, profile image, 
active status and so on. 

Future scope:
